// Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-place 
// so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

// We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

// You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.


// Example 1:

// Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
// Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

In-place algorithm

In computer science, an in-place algorithm is an algorithm that transforms the input data without using any additional 
data structures. In other words, it updates the input data in place, rather than creating a new copy of the data.

The advantages of in-place algorithms are that they save memory, reduce the amount of data copying, and are often faster than 
algorithms that require additional data structures. However, in-place algorithms can be more difficult to design and implement, 
and they may have limitations on the types of operations that can be performed on the input data.

Some examples of in-place algorithms include:

Sorting algorithms like Quicksort and Heapsort, which rearrange the elements of an array in place.
Reversing an array, which swaps the first and last elements, then the second and second-to-last elements, and so on, until the array is reversed.
Removing duplicates from a sorted array, which updates the array in place to remove any duplicates.
Rotating an array, which shifts the elements of the array to the left or right without using additional memory.
Rearranging an array such that all even numbers come before odd numbers or vice versa, which involves swapping elements in place based on a certain condition.
Overall, in-place algorithms are an important concept in computer science and are widely used in a variety of applications.
